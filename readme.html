<h3>Actions Configured</h3>
<ul>
  <li>test connectivity</li>
  <li>update yara sources</li>
  <li>list yara sources</li>
  <li>clear yara sources</li>
  <li>yara scan</li>
</ul>

<h4>update yara sources</h4>
<p><b>Requires a configured asset with 1 or more Environment Variables set to be a list of sources to download.</b>
  <br><br>
  This will iterate over all sources configured in an asset and explode any .zip or individual files into the
  applications's state directory. The files here can be listed
  or loaded for a scan later, allowing one asset to be built with many sources of Yara rules, possibly serving many use
  cases.

<h4>list yara sources</h4>
<p>
  <br><br>
  This will list any items found with the provided file glob for path, if provided. If not provided, it will default to
  a file glob of *, listing everything in the application's state directory (one-level deep). Also, if checked, "stat
  info"
  will provide detailed information about each file found as returned by <a
    href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.stat">os.stat_result</a>
  <br><br>
  For reference, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.glob">Python's pathlib.Path.glob
    documentation can show some examples.</a>
</p>

<h4>clear yara sources</h4>
<p>
  <br><br>This will clear any files in the state directory that do not end with "state.json". If provided, the "path"
  parameter will be used to further limit the clearing to a sub-directory of the asset's downloaded files.
</p>

<h4>yara scan</h4>
<p>
  <br><br>This will load any Yara rules found at "yara path", defaulting to "**/*.yar" if not provided. Those loaded
  rules are compiled and saved
  for use later, cached at a new file in the state directory. If that cache cannot be found or read, the rules are
  compiled and loaded
  again. The scan will look for "scan dir" first, falling back to reading the file found at the provided "vault id".
  <b>One of "vault id" or "scan dir"
    must be provided!</b>
  <br><br>
  If specified, "use_includes" can be set to allow your rules to include other rules. Similarly, Yara rule time out can
  be overridden along with runtime
  configuration for Yara like "stack size", "max strings per rule" and "max match data".

  For reference to these settings, see <a
